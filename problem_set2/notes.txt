alpha-motor neuron - signals to muscles, tells what to do
	acetylecholine 

excitiation-contraction coupling 

	motor-untit: one motor neuron and all the fibers it connects to
		synapse is somtimes called neural-motor junction 

	large muscle force corresponds to 

proprioception system (fancy word for "body sense") 


corticalspinal tract (CST)
	- "Medullary pyramids", as moves through axon bundles in medulla 
	- decasation occurs right below medula 


primary motor cortex (M1)
	- within frontal lobe 
	- Large area is devoted to fingers, lips which require fine motor activity 




Rate Coding
	sensory events and/or motor events 

	Rate is an important metric for determining 
	Encode variables (timestamp and what location)
		- Captures two paramters and encodes them into 

	How do we make sense of rate coding?
		- Look for special events .
		- View spikes around special events (Measured action potentials)
		- Categorizing events, 
			Resorit
			Spike alignment - to make sense of relationship between 
					events and spikes 

			Spike raster 

			Rain all events into histogram bins (PSTH)
				Peristimulus Time Histogram (Post-stimulus time histogram)
					What happens after the stimulus. 
				- Spikes fall down into gauge 

			Many trials in one activity would build large bins,
				but that doens't give relative data on bins with less trials.

			Take mean, number of counts divided by the number of trials 
			"How wise is the rain gauge?" 
			Ballpark ranges (on order 10-100 miliseconds is useful for neuroscience

			divisor as bin width 
			spikes per second (y-axis) , time (x-axis) 

		Look for background, or spontaneous rate. 



	In the lab for this week, we'll be exporing the idea of the tuning curve.
	Which is a tool that neuroscientists use to try and "crack the code" of signals
	generated by the various kinds of neurons. 
	Tuning curve will convey the range of sensory input for which a neuron responds.
