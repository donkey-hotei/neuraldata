#  NAME
#    problem_set1.py
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#    Open, view, and analyze raw extracellular data
#    In Problem Set 1, you will write create and test your own spike detector.
#
#   In this assignment we'll be:
#       - Write a function that locates action potentials in an electrical signal.
#       - Write a function to plot the action potentials we've located
#       - Write a function to display the locations of the action potentials within a given signal
